   At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.
   When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph
   which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles.
   webpack compiles JavaScript modules.
   Once installed, you can interface with webpack either from its CLI or API.
