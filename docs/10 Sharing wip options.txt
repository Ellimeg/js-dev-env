Sharing work-in-progress
========================
Browser sync does not expose a public ip (for testing) outside your local network
To share your work on public web (not aws or azure as these costs!)
options:

localtunnel - easiest + works with browser sync
punches hole in firewall so loacl machine can operate as web server
npm install localtunnel -g
start your app
lt --port3000

ngrok - more secure - reqs login
punches hole in firewall so loacl machine can operate as web server
sign up
intsall ngrok
install authtoken
start app
./ngrok http 80

now  - no dependency
Does not punch hole in ur firewall
Deploys your app up (if has package.json i.e. a Node.js app) to the cloud (Nows server)
each time you deploy you'll get a new unique url
can be used for producton
install: npm install -g now
Create a start script that opens your preferred web server e.g. express
To deploy just type: now
Good option if you have a server side componant thats node based as its always on.

surge
like now but only supports static files
Deploy  static files only
install: npm install -g surge
run; surge (prompts for un and pwd - else it will use your existing)
