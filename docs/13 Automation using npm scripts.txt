Call seperate files from the scripts section of the package.json

1. Creating npm script that starts up our dev env:
1.1 create 'start' section in scripts (By convention its called 'start')
1.2 @> npm start <= opens up the application

Note there is no need to type the run keyword with either

  npm start = npm run start
  npm test = npm run test

npm scripts add node_modules/.bin to the path automatically

packages called from npm scripts do not need to be installed globally :-)
