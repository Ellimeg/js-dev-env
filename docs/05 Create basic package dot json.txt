1. In VSCode: Create new file in the project root called package.json

2. Paste in the following:
	{
	  "name": "javascript-dev-env",
  	   "version": "1.0.0",
	  "license": "MIT",
	  "private": true,
	  "description": "JavaScript development environment",
	  "keywords": [
	    "learning",
	    "js",
	    "dev-env"
 		 ],
	  "repository": "github:Ellimeg/js-dev-env",
	  "author": "Roger Gooding",  
	  "scripts": {},
	}

Note: 'scripts' section is initially empty but we will be adding to this bit to automate our processes.
