# js-dev-env
JavaScript Development Environment from Pluralsight Course with Corey House

Open in .Code

To run Hello world from command line run the following node command from the js-dev-env folder:

	js-dev-env> node .\buildScripts\srcServer.js

I'm half way swapping out the Server from Express to Webpack to demo Lodash but its not plumbed in.
